<p> Welcome to 'De Slakkenplaag van 24'. This year, we’ve seen an unusual number of snails, and we’re here to figure out if it’s really a plague or just a strange coincidence. This website invites you to unravel the mystery through various data visualizations and an interactive map that showcases real-time findings from my, <b>then</b> ongoing research
</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>I invite users to dive into the topic and feel like detectives on a mission. As they explore various data points, they can try to connect the dots and piece together the puzzle. I aimed for an interactive experience, so it’s not just a site for reading. This approach creates an engaging environment where users can learn while actively participating in the investigation.</p>

<p>All my external data collections come from Waarneming.nl and KNMI. On <a href="https://waarneming.nl/">waarneming.nl</a>, I specifically searched for the Spanish slug and discovered that I could filter data by day, radius, and more. This allowed me to find out how many slugs were reported on any given day.</p>


For weather data, I checked <a href="https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/maand-en-seizoensoverzichten/2024/mei">KNMI</a> for solid statistics. I also looked at other sites like <a href="https://www.weeronline.nl/nieuws/weeroverzichten-2024-mei">WeerOnline</a> and <a href="https://weerstatistieken.nl/de-bilt/2024/mei">Weerstatistieken</a> to gather more detailed weather information for May 2024.

<p>For my internal data, I visited several school gardens to count the number of slugs near the end of September and the start of October. I took pictures of the slugs I found too. I also used <a href="https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer">Zeeschuimer</a>, to fetch data from social media like Instagram. From pictures, dates, hashtags, etc. Another tool I used was  <a href="https://4cat.nl/">4Cat</a>, where I uploaded my Zeeschuimer data and create filtered datasets.</p>

<p>This project was actually for school, therefore I was limited to just a number of weeks. If had more time, I would've continued developing the following:</p>

- [ ] Migrating this to a react environment ( `Note: During our fall recess, I was curious to see how long it would take to do this. I eventually did create a fully functional react environment, but the code was too complex for my understanding, so in time, once I my knowledge has increased, I hope to migrate it one day.`)

- [ ] Refacture for a better structure.
- [ ] Store my data into an actual database.
- [ ] Allowing more interaction for the user (Like a pop-up log they can fill in during their research)
